# VueJS Guidelines

- Always use the Vue Composition API script setup style.
- Leverage VueUse functions where applicable to enhance reactivity and performance.

# UI and Styling
- Use Vuetify components where needed unless there is a more specific library available for a component. For example if sweetalert2 is installed, use it for alerts instead of using vuetify alerts.
- Implement responsive designS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Build UI components using atomic design principles, organizing them from smallest to largest (e.g., atoms, molecules, organisms, pages).
- Wrap asynchronous components in Suspense with a fallback UI.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
